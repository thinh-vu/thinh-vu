## 💫 My Story in 30 Seconds

From launching my career as a Data Analyst at Vietnam's leading e-commerce platform to becoming the creator of [Vnstock](http://vnstock.site) with 350K+ downloads, my journey has been driven by a simple philosophy: **technology should liberate, not complicate**.

I've spent a decade transforming complex data into clarity and start building tools that help people make smarter investment decisions in recent years. My work bridges the gap between technical innovation and practical, everyday value—proving that with the right approach, anyone can leverage technology to work smarter, not harder.
